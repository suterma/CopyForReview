# CopyForReview
A Visual Studio extension for formatted copying of code snippets.

Allows to copy code, with file, class, method and line info, suitable for code reviews. 
This supports creating written reviews of source code.

Currently, only a foswiki-styled output is supported, and only for C# code files.

Note: This extension is in Beta stage. Feedback is highly welcome. Please email to marcel@codeministry.ch.
